to run the program:
    enter backend directory and run ".\venv\Scripts\activate", if this doesn't work run "python -m venv venv" and then ".\venv\Scripts\activate" at the root directory
    also run "pip install -r requirements.txt"
    then go back to main directory and run "uvicorn app.main:app --reload"
    now you can go to frontend directory and run "npm start"
